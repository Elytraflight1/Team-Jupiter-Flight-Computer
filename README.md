Capabilities:
- Record altitude, temperature, and accelerometer data via BMP388 altimeter and built-in accelerometer to the Arduino Nano 33 IOT
- Save this data to SD card real-time, along with timestamps
- Indicate when it is armed (e.g. with LED, wifi connection)
- Trigger servo to rotate back and forth at a specific altitude/time
- Be self-sufficient with 3.7V drone battery
